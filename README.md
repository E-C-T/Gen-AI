# Gen-AI Project Repository

Welcome to my Gen-AI project repository! This repository is a place to explore and develop project ideas using generative AI technologies. Here, you'll find a variety of projects and examples that demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI in different contexts.

## What's Inside
- **LangServe Chatbot**: A conversational agent built with LangChain and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), using a vector database for contextual responses.
- **LLM Weather App**: An AI-powered weather application that uses LangChain chains, agents, and image generation to provide weather forecasts and related information.
